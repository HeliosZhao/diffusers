# AutoPipeline

In many cases, one checkpoint can be used for multiple tasks. You may be able the same checkpoint for Text-to-Image, Image-to-Image and Inpainting, as long as you know which pipelines are linked to your checkpoint. 

AutoPipeline is designed to help you switch between different tasks seamlessly using the same checkpoint. It automatically retrieve the relevant pipeline for the task your want to perform, given the name/path to the pretrained weights.
